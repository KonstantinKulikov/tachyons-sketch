# tachyons-sketch

Functional sketch-symbols for humans.

Based on [tachyons-css](https://github.com/tachyons-css/tachyons)

## Why sketch?

Our goal is to transfer the tachyons design system approach into the workflow of sketchapp. This Idea and repository is based on the discussion for adding a [sketch template / styleguide](https://github.com/tachyons-css/tachyons/issues/284) for static designing
